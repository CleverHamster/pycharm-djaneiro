# **Djaneiro for Pycharm** #

This is a port of the Djaneiro plugin for Sublime Text to Jetbrains'  
Pycharm IDE.  Kudos to those guys.  Full details and docs can be found at    
their repo on github: [https://github.com/squ1b3r/Djaneiro](https://github.com/squ1b3r/Djaneiro)

It's basically a collection of convenient abbreviations encountered when  
building Django applications (with a couple generic python uses) specifically  
aimed at models, forms, views, templates, properties, basic python objects,  
and other commonly typed patterns.
